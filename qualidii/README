Before running the application, you need a current version of Node.js on your computer

                >Here : https://nodejs.org/en/

Next you want to navigate to the /qlt directory in the terminal, or open a console in the /qlt directory

                >Command: cd /<DIRECTORY>

After opening the console in the directory, you want to install the dependancies to your machine. They are much too big to include in the source, so this is the easiest way to do it.

                >run the command: npm install

This will automatically install all dependancies to your machine. (You can delete these later if you wish.)

After the install, run the command: npm start

This will start the react scripts and open the project in your default web browser.

Any questions can be forwarded to me
